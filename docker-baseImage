# NO ENTRYPOINT ALLOWED: This is an Installation Image for Server Software Installations such as Tomcat.

# Existing version is Tomcat_v7.0, in the future if this changes to Tomcat7.1 or higher - the 'wget' url will change accordingly.
# Installation commands for Tomcat would still be the same even if the version changes., - So, No change to the rest of the instructions
#
# We do not want to Start Any Services here, we Install and Set the PATH of the Installations in Environment & we finalize this Image, thats the purpose of the base image.
