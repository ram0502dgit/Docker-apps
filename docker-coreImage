# Install Pip Packages - future use
# DO NOT INSTALL Web Server like Apache here: use the Base Image for that @ the next step
# DO NOT EXPOSE Ports on this image
# DO NOT use ENTRYPOINT on this image
# Thats not the intention of generating a core image.
# Why ? This is because it is an Architectural Decision! to allow & extend the docker functionality, future use and reuse of the core Image
