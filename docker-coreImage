# DO NOT INSTALL Web Server like Apache here: use the Base Image @ the next step
# DO NOT EXPOSE Ports on this image
# DO NOT use ENTRYPOINT on this image
#
# Thats not the intention of generating a core image. #  Why ?
# This is because to allow & extend the docker functionality, future use and reuse of the core Image by multiple base Images that has different Web Server installations
#
